        <h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>I wrote Joe_CMS after trying to get some of the "big" CMS's <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, etc. working for weeks. </p>

<p><em>The intent of this CMS is the right balance between features and simplicity, leaning toward simplicity.</em></p>

<p>Key Features of Joe_CMS are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ease of Use!</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Basic Markdown driven CMS</li>
<li>Easy configurability</li>
</ul><p>You can create new pages easily, link within the site easily and manage a blog easily. You can even make changes to the CSS and templates online (if you're so inclined), you guessed it, easily. </p>

<p>If you want to dive into setting up Joe_CMS, head on over to the quickstart guide: </p>

<p><a href="http://whoisjoe.com/Show.aspx?page=Joe_CMS_Quickstart">http://whoisjoe.com/Show.aspx?page=Joe_CMS_Quickstart</a></p>

<p>On this page you'll find some help on how to modify Joe_CMS and make it yours.</p>

</ul><h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Joe_CMS is split into three different major areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Default.aspx - This is the first page people will see when they arrive on your site. You can edit it and it will pull styles from the css file, but it's a special page in that it can display your news or blog items in the middle.</li>
<li>News.aspx - I call this section 'News,' but you may think of it as your blog. I like to use it to post chronological items like updates to the site, new insights or each time I meet The President.</li>
<li>All Other Pages - All the other pages are up to you to create. They all follow the pattern <code>Show.aspx?page=MyPageName</code>. The 'MyPageName' bit tells the system which page you're requesting. As an administrator you can create as many of these as you'd like. Please feel free to edit these as often as you'd like, Joe_CMS automatically keeps a history of every save, so if you make a mistake you can easily go back.</li>
</ul><p>That's about it. If you can remember those things everything else should be a breeze.</p>

<h2>Templates</h2>

<p>I think the Joe_CMS templating system is pretty easy to understand, I've tried to reduce as much complexity as possible. First of all, if you like the way the site looks now, there's nothing more for you to do. If you do want to change the theme, read on.</p>

<p><em>note: for all of this stuff you'll have to be logged in, so be sure to do that before proceeding</em></p>

<h3>Default.aspx</h3>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, Default.aspx is a bit of a special page. That means that it doesn't follow the same template as the rest of the site. Just click the link at the very bottom of the page that says 'Edit This Page' That will take you to the <a href="EditDefault.aspx">EditDefault.aspx</a> page that will allow you to edit the look and feel of this front page. It has three main sections: The Title, Body and Header.</p>

<h4>Title</h4>

<p>The title is the title of this page. This title will show up just for this page. You might want to call it something like 'Welcome to My Website' or something like that.</p>

<h4>Body</h4>

<p>The Body section is for everything else on the page. If you use the drop-down menu you can put HTML or Markdown in this section. If you want something really fancy I suggest playing around with HTML. If you're new to this whole thing or you want to get something up quickly, I suggest Markdown, since it's easier to use and quicker to write.</p>

<p>In either case you should remember to put two special anchors in this document. One is <code>&amp;&amp;SYSTEM_CONTENT&amp;&amp;</code> and the other is <code>&amp;&amp;SYSTEM_LOGIN&amp;&amp;</code>. You have to type these exactly as they are here or they won't work</p>

<h5>&amp;&amp;SYSTEM_CONTENT&amp;&amp;</h5>

<p>The <code>&amp;&amp;SYSTEM_CONTENT&amp;&amp;</code> anchor is where the content of the page will go.</p>

<p>On the <code>Default.aspx</code> page this is where the news posts will go. If you forget to put this in your template the news items won't show up. This can be useful if you don't want your news on the front page and you're going to link to it. You can find it at on the <a href="News.aspx">News Page</a>.</p>

<h5>&amp;&amp;SYSTEM_LOGIN&amp;&amp;</h5>

<p>The <code>&amp;&amp;SYSTEM_LOGIN&amp;&amp;</code> anchor is where Joe_CMS will help you login or log out.</p>

<p>It will put a little text that will either say 'login' if you haven't logged in or 'You are currently logged in as: [your name] click here to logout.' I usually put this at the bottom of the page, since most people won't be logging into your site, but you can put it anywhere you'd like, or leave it off the site completely if you'll remember the <a href="Login.aspx">Login Page Address</a>.</p>

<h4>Header</h4>

<p>If there is something that you need to put into the </p> tags on each page you can put it in this text box. You probably don't have to do this, but sometimes you'll have to put analytics, css or rss stuff up there. If you don't know what I'm talking about don't worry about this section (that why I put the 'header' at the bottom)

<h2>News</h2>

<p>As I mentioned above, the news section is for anything that you'll be adding chronologically, like a blog. You can even call it your blog if you'd like.</p>

<h3>Creating a new News Post</h3>

<p>To create a new news post just browse to the <a href="News.aspx">News Page</a> and click the <a href="EditNews.aspx">Add New Article</a> link. That will take you another page that contains three text boxes. The first one is the Title of the post, the second is the date it should be published and the third is the body of your post.</p>

<h4>Title</h4>

<p>This will can be anything and will show at the top of the page.</p>

<h4>Date</h4>

<p>If you leave this blank your post will be immediately visible, and this will default to the current date and time. </p>

<p>If you'd like to back-date a post put in the date you'd like in the following format: <strong>1/30/2012 11:30:00 AM</strong> The post will be sorted chronologically when visitors view the <a href="News.aspx">News.aspx</a> page.</p>

<p>If you put in a future date into this field the post will not be visible to normal users until that date. It will still be visible to you, but the title will be pre-pended with '(Not Yet Published)' so you'll know you are the only person who can see it.</p>

<p><strong>A little on date formats</strong> - If you just put a date in there (month/day/year) it'll default to 12:00:00 AM. If you're a fan of 24hr time you can use that instead of 2:00 PM. Oh and you don't have to put seconds on if you don't want to be that precise.</p>

<h3>Editing a News Post</h3>

<p>To Edit a post just browse to the post by clicking on the 'read more', 'link to this article' or the title. Once you click that link you'll be taken the same page you used to create the post, but the title, date and body will be populated for you. You can choose to change anything you'd like, including the date. Just like before if you delete the date field completely it will default to the current date and time.</p>

<h2>Pages</h2>

<p>Kind of like a wiki you can create as many pages on your site as you'd like. There are a few ways to create and edit pages, and like anything you can only create and edit pages if you're logged in.</p>

<h3>Creating a new Page</h3>

<p>The easiest way to create a page is to browse to <a href="Edit.aspx">Edit.aspx</a>. On that page you can add a title, sub-title, url, and a body to your new page. You can also choose to make a page a draft (not yet visible to normal users) or private (only visible to logged in users).</p>

<h4>Title</h4>

<p>This will be displayed at the top of the page.</p>

<p>If you're thinking about styling your pages further, it will be wrapped in an &lt;h1&gt; and it will reference the 'PageTitle' css class.</p>

<h4>Subtitle</h4>

<p>This will be displayed right under the Title.</p>

<p>If you're thinking about styling your pages further, it will be wrapped in an &lt;h2&gt; and it will reference the 'PageSubTitle' css class.</p>

<h4>Url</h4>

<p>If you want to specify a specific url you can override the default by putting something here. If you leave this blank it will automatically convert whatever you type in the Title field to a URL friendly value. If you're unsure about this, I'd leave it blank.</p>

<h4>Body</h4>

<p>Pages bodies can handle HTML or Markdown. You can specify what language you're writing in using the drop down. As I mentioned above HTML is good for complex things, but <a href="markdown">Markdown</a> is nice for quick pages, you can do almost all the important things in markdown (this page is written in markdown!)</p>

<p><strong>links in markdown</strong> - usually a link in markdown looks like this <code>[text](url)</code> but I've made this a little easier so you don't have to type the whole <code>[text](Show.aspx?page=MyPage)</code> every time, instead you can just type <code>[text](MyPage)</code> and Joe_CMS will look up the right page for you.</p>

<h3>Editing an existing Page</h3>

<p>When you're logged in you should see a couple of new links. If you click the one that says 'Edit this page' you'll be taken back to the page that you used to create the page with all the fields filled in. </p>

<p>When you save the page again you will automatically create a new copy. You can view and revert to old copies at any time, so don't worry about messing anything up, even if you accidentally delete everything you'll still be able to get back what you had. Which leads me to:</p>

<h3>Viewing a Page's History</h3>

<p>If you click the other link that says 'See Previous Versions' you'll see a list of all the previous versions and when they were saved. If you click the title of one of the versions you can see the complete text and choose to revert to that version. When you 'revert' to the previous version you're actually just creating a copy of the old version and marking that as the newest version of the page. So if you accidentally overwrite a good version of your page, just go back to the version history and revert back to the page that you were just on.</p>

<h2>Other Settings</h2>

<p>There are a few other settings that you may want to change such as the name of your site, the number of news items to display on the front page, and whether or not you'd like to display social networking links on the site. You can do all of that on the <a href="Settings.aspx">Settings</a> page.</p>
